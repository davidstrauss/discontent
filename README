Goals
=====

Definitely:
 * Zero redundancy with what's offered in systemd. This means no redundant code
   for privilege dropping, daemonization, socket initialization, or logging
 * Markdown for formatting posts
 * Flat file storage in git
 * Good HTTP caching headers
 * Paginated index of posts

Maybe:
 * Certificates and TOTP for authentication
 * External authentication
 * Commenting, probably using an external service
 * Automated syndication, probably using an external service
 * Atom and RSS

Definitely not:
 * WYSIWYG
